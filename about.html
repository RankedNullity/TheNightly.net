          Hello, I'm Jaron Wang, the creator of this website. I was born in
          Beijing, China, and moved to the United States when I was just
          entering grade school, so about 8 years old. I've been around most of
          the west coast, having lived in most parts of California, Oregon, and
          Washington.

          I went to high school at Redmond High School (Washington) and with
          the help of some of the most wonderful teachers I've ever met, I
          found my passion for all things science and technology. And if that
          sounds broad, that's because it is. I took AP class after AP class,
          hoping to narrow down my passions; instead, I only added to the list.
          By the time I graduated, I was left with more questions than answers.
          <br>
          <br>
          The fall after graduation, I started attending the University of
          Washington with my ego a little too bloated from high school. That
          quarter, I took 22 credits while working full time as a sous chef.
          Needless to say, my hubris took its toll. As crazy as I am,
          it was still a <strong>little</strong> much, even for me. Following
          that, I decided to take it easy and take some intro-level courses,
          so I could find my true interests. Then, I heard this quote somewhere.
        </p>
          <blockquote>
            "If you ever have to make a decision, flip a coin. Bet on the
            outcome, and if you regret the decision you made, then you should
            chose the other option."
          </blockquote>
        <p>
          Which is essentially what I did. The whole time I was taking other
          classes, I just felt myself craving for a math class. So that was
          eventually what I decided on. Now, I'm midway through my third year
          double majoring in Applied and Compuational Mathematical Sciences
          (ACMS) and Theoretical Mathematics with a minor in Physics, and I
          quite like it. Currently, I'm taking:
          <ul class="double-list">

              MATH462: Combinatorial Theory II</a></li>

          I always have a hard time distinguishing between "Hobbies" and
          "Interests". To me, a hobby is something you do in your free time,
          and interests are something you take more seriously. This never made
          sense to me, because I have fun when with my interests, and I take
          my hobbies seriously. So I guess for the purposes of splitting them,
          I shall use a societal perspetive when determing the label "Hobby" or
          "Interest".
