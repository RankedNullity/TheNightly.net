          Hello, I'm Jaron Wang, the creator of this website. I was born in
          Beijing, China, and moved to California when I was about eight years
          old. There, my family and I moved from place to place every year until
          I landed in Davis, California. I stayed there for about two years,
          until my family decided to relocate to Washington. I stayed in
          Bellevue until the end of that year, then moved to Redmond,
          where I currently reside. As you can tell, I've been around. However,
          I quite like the climate in Washington, so I don't think I'd be
          moving much more.

          I went to high school at Redmond High School (Washington) and with
          the help of some of the most wonderful teachers I've ever met, I
          found my passion for all things science and technology. And if that
          sounds broad, that's because it is. I took AP class after AP class,
          hoping to narrow down my passions; instead, I only added to the list.
          By the time I graduated, I was left with more questions than answers.
          <br>
          <br>
          The fall after graduation, I started attending the University of
          Washington with my ego a little too bloated from high school. That
          quarter, I took 22 credits while working full time as a sous chef.
          Needless to say, my hubris took its toll. As crazy as I am,
          it was still a <strong>little</strong> much, even for me. Following
          that, I decided to take it easy and take some intro-level courses,
          so I could find my true interests. Then, I heard this quote somewhere.
        </p>
          <blockquote>
            "If you ever have to make a decision, flip a coin. Bet on the
            outcome, and if you regret the decision you made, then you should
            chose the other option."
          </blockquote>
        <p>
          Which is essentially what I did. The whole time I was taking other
          classes, I just felt myself craving for a math class. So that was
          eventually what I decided on. Now, I'm starting my third year
          double majoring in Applied and Compuational Mathematical Sciences
          (ACMS) and Theoretical Mathematics with a minor in Physics, and I
          quite like it. Currently, I'm taking:
