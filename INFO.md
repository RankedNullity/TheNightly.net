## Credits
Credits go out to w3schools for teaching me most of the design on this site.
A lot of ideas were inspired from there as well. Credit to Husky Satellite Labs
for giving me the idea on the navbar.

## Takeaway
I learned that java script runs things before it runs initialize(). So,
to get any relevant data from the document, you must get it in initialize.
Also, parallax is surprisingly easy with css.

## Future work
In the future, I plan on putting all tech demos and projects in the assorted
sections, and get other contributors on the project.
